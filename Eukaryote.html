<h1>Eukaryotes</h1>
<hr>
    <p> Eukaryotes  are organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within membranes,
       unlike prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea), which have no membrane-bound organelles.[3][4][5] Eukaryotes
        belong to the domain Eukaryota or Eukarya. Their name comes from the Greek εὖ (eu, "well" or "true")
        and κάρυον (karyon, "nut" or "kernel").[6] Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles
         such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus, and in addition, some cells of plants and algae contain chloroplasts
          Unlike unicellular archaea and bacteria, eukaryotes may also be multicellular and include organisms consisting of many
           cell types forming different kinds of tissue. Animals and plants are the most familiar eukaryotes.</p>
<hr>
           <p>Eukaryotes can reproduce both asexually through mitosis and sexually through meiosis and gamete
              fusion. In mitosis, one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells. In meiosis, DNA replication
              is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four haploid daughter cells. These act as sex cells (gametes).
              Each gamete has just one set of chromosomes, each a unique mix of the corresponding pair of parental chromosomes resulting
              from genetic recombination during meiosis.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The domain Eukaryota appears to be monophyletic, and makes up one of the domains of life in the three-domain
                 system. The two other domains, Bacteria and Archaea, are prokaryotes[7] and have none of the above features.
                  Eukaryotes represent a tiny minority of all living things.[8] However, due to their generally much larger size,
                   their collective worldwide biomass is estimated to be about equal to that of prokaryotes.[8] Eukaryotes evolved
                   approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago, during the Proterozoic eon.</p>
